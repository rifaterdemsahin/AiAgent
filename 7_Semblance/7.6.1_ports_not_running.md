Great! Your Docker build was successful. Now you're encountering a port conflict when trying to run the container - something is already using port 5000 on your host machine.

You have a few options to resolve this:

1. Use a different port on the host side:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:5000 ai-agent
```
This maps port 5000 in the container to port 8080 on your host, avoiding the conflict.

2. Find and stop whatever is using port 5000:
   - On macOS, you can use: `lsof -i :5000` to see what's using the port
   - Then stop that process (could be another container or application)

3. Choose a completely different port for both sides:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 ai-agent
```
This would require updating your application to listen on port 8080 instead of 5000.

Since option 1 is simplest and doesn't require changing your application, I'd recommend:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:5000 ai-agent
```

Then you can access your application at http://localhost:8080
