## Setting Up Docker on Windows

To install Docker on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Docker Desktop website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download the latest version for Windows.
2. Run the downloaded executable file.
3. Follow the installation wizard's instructions:
   - During the setup process, select the type of Docker Engine you want to use (WSL 2 is recommended).
   - Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements specified by Docker.
4. After installation completes, open Docker Desktop from the Start menu or taskbar and log in using your Docker Hub credentials.
5. Once logged in, verify that Docker is running properly by opening a terminal and typing `docker --version` to see the installed version.
