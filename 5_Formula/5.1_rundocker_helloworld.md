Here's how to run a Docker hello-world container in GitHub Codespaces:

```bash
# Make sure Docker is running in your codespace
docker --version

# Pull and run the hello-world container
docker run hello-world
```

When you run this, you should see output similar to:

```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.
...
```

This confirms that Docker is properly set up in your Codespace environment. GitHub Codespaces come with Docker pre-installed, so you should be able to run Docker commands right away without additional setup.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of running Docker in Codespaces?

Hello from Docker!

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:

 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
