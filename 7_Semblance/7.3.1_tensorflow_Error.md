I'll make the following changes to address your issue:

1. First, I'll update `7_Semblance/7.1_mac_not_found_python.md` to include troubleshooting steps for macOS not found errors:
```markdown /path/to/7_Semblance/7.1_mac_not_found_python.md
# Troubleshooting Mac Not Found Error

## Issue Description
If you encounter an error indicating that your Mac is not found, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Ensure your development environment is set up correctly.
2. Verify the installation of necessary dependencies.
3. Check if the machine's MAC address has been updated in the system configuration.
4. If using a virtual machine, ensure its network settings are properly configured.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve any Mac not found error.
```

2. Next, let's modify `7_Semblance/7.3.1_tensorflow_Error.md` to provide solutions for TensorFlow errors:
```markdown /path/to/7_Semblance/7.3.1_tensorflow_Error.md
# Fixing TensorFlow Errors

## Common Issues and Solutions
If you encounter TensorFlow-related errors, try the following:

1. Make sure your Python version is compatible with TensorFlow.
2. Update TensorFlow to the latest stable release using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade tensorflow
   ```
3. Check if all required hardware accelerators are properly installed and configured.
4. Ensure that your GPU drivers are up-to-date.

These steps should help you resolve most TensorFlow-related issues.
```

Summary:
- Updated `7_Semblance/7.1_mac_not_found_python.md` with troubleshooting tips for macOS not found errors.
- Modified `7_Semblance/7.3.1_tensorflow_Error.md` to include solutions for common TensorFlow errors.
These edits ensure that users have clear guidance on how to resolve both macOS and TensorFlow-specific issues.

It looks like `pip` is unable to find a compatible version of TensorFlow for your system. Let's troubleshoot step by step:

### 1. **Check Python Version**  
TensorFlow requires a compatible Python version. Run:  
```bash
python --version
```
TensorFlow 2.x supports **Python 3.7 - 3.11**. If you have Python 3.12 or lower than 3.7, it won't install.

### 2. **Check Pip Version**  
Ensure `pip` is up to date:  
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3. **Ensure Virtual Environment is Using the Correct Python**  
Inside your virtual environment (`venv`), check:  
```bash
which python
which pip
```
If they don't point to your virtual environment (`venv`), you might need to activate it properly:  
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 4. **Try Installing a Specific Version**  
```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.13.0
```
or  
```bash
pip install tensorflow-macos  # For Apple Silicon (M1/M2)
```

### 5. **Check Compatibility (For M1/M2 Macs)**  
If you have an **Apple Silicon (M1/M2)** Mac, install TensorFlow specifically for macOS:  
```bash
pip install tensorflow-macos
pip install tensorflow-metal 
 # For GPU acceleration
```

### 6. **Try Installing with `--no-cache-dir`**  
If the above steps fail, try:  
```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir tensorflow
```

If none of these work, let me know your **Python version**, **macOS version**, and whether you're using an **M1/M2 chip**. ðŸš€

You're using **Python 3.13**, which is **not supported** by TensorFlow. TensorFlow currently supports **Python 3.7 - 3.11**.

### Fix: Install a Compatible Python Version  
You need to install **Python 3.10 or 3.11**. Here's how:

#### **Step 1: Install Python 3.10 or 3.11**
Run one of the following:

```bash
brew install python@3.10
# OR
brew install python@3.11
```

#### **Step 2: Use the Correct Python Version**
Since your default Python is 3.13, you need to use the correct version in your virtual environment.

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
# OR
python3.11 -m venv venv
```

#### **Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### **Step 4: Check Python Version Inside Virtual Env**
```bash
python --version
```
It should now be **3.10 or 3.11**.

#### **Step 5: Install TensorFlow**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install tensorflow
```

If you're on an **M1/M2 Mac**, install the macOS version:
```bash
pip install tensorflow-macos
pip install tensorflow-metal
```

Now, TensorFlow should install correctly! ðŸš€ Let me know if you hit any issues.
