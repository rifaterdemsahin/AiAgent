move out of bin
The alert you're seeing indicates that macOS has incorrectly identified Docker as malware. This sometimes happens with Docker on M1 Macs due to security features. Here's how to fix it:

1. Open System Preferences (or System Settings on newer macOS)
2. Go to "Security & Privacy" or "Privacy & Security"
3. Click on the "General" tab
4. Look for a message about Docker being blocked and click "Allow Anyway"
5. Try opening Docker again

If that doesn't work, try these additional steps:

1. Download Docker directly from the official Docker website (make sure you get the Apple Silicon version)
2. Move the previous blocked version from Bin to Trash
3. Install the new download
4. When prompted, allow it in Security settings

You might need to right-click the Docker app and select "Open" the first time to bypass Gatekeeper. If problems persist, consider temporarily disabling Gatekeeper using Terminal or using Docker alternatives like Podman or Lima that work better with Apple Silicon.
