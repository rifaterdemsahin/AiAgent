It looks like the Docker container is running but can't find the `app.py` file. This suggests there might be an issue with the file structure or file naming in your project. Let's troubleshoot:

1. First, check if the file exists in your project folder:
```bash
ls -la
```

2. If `app.py` doesn't exist but your main Python file has a different name, you'll need to modify the CMD in your Dockerfile to use the correct filename.

3. Let's see what files actually got copied into the container:
```bash
docker run -it ai-agent ls -la /app
```

If you see your application file with a different name (like `main.py` or `server.py`), you have two options:

1. Rename your file to `app.py` locally
2. Update your Dockerfile with the correct filename:
```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "your_actual_filename.py"]
```

If your file exists but is in a subdirectory, you'll need to update the path in the CMD instruction or ensure the COPY command correctly places the file at the expected location.

I see the issue now. Your main Python file is probably inside the `/app/app` directory rather than directly in the `/app` directory. This is why the container can't find `app.py` - it's looking in the wrong place.

You have two options to fix this:

1. Update the CMD in your Dockerfile to point to the actual location:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies required for building h5py
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    pkg-config \
    libhdf5-dev \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    build-essential \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . /app

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Update CMD to point to the correct file location
CMD ["python", "app/app.py"]
```

2. Or run the container specifying the correct path:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:5000 ai-agent python app/app.py
```

Let's verify what's in the app directory to make sure:

```bash
docker run -it ai-agent ls -la /app/app
```

This should show you the contents of the `/app/app` directory, and you can check for the main Python file there.
