I see a new error in the build logs. Now that pkg-config is installed, the build is failing because gcc (the C compiler) is missing. Let's update the Dockerfile to include gcc and any other build tools needed:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies required for building h5py
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    pkg-config \
    libhdf5-dev \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    build-essential \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . /app

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Fix the CMD format to use JSON array format
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

The main update here is adding:
1. `gcc` - the C compiler that's missing according to the error message
2. `g++` - C++ compiler that might be needed for some packages
3. `build-essential` - common build tools and libraries

This should address the error: "command 'gcc' failed: No such file or directory" that appeared in the new logs.
